Changes since version 3.1.1 (HEAD)
---------------------------     

- Changed the mapping of sequence<byte> for performance reasons:

  - A string is now accepted as a legal value when sequence<byte> is
    expected. An array of integers is also accepted, but the Ice run
    time validates every element of the array to ensure it is in the
    proper range, therefore using an array is much slower than using
    a string.

  - A sequence<byte> value is now always received as a string.

- Added UnexpectedObjectException. This exception is raised if you
  use Slice classes and client and server are compiled with mismatched
  Slice definitions. Alternatively, this exception is raised if you
  use dynamic invocation and pass a class of the wrong type as an
  operation parameter.

- The Slice keyword 'nonmutating' is now deprecated; 'idempotent'
  should be used instead. A new metadata directive is supported for
  backward-compatibility (see below).

- New Slice metadata for operations:

  - ["nonmutating"] provides backward compatibility for idempotent
    operations that were previously declared using the deprecated
    'nonmutating' keyword. You can replace the 'nonmutating' keyword
    with '["nonmutating"] idempotent' to maintain compatibility with
    objects implemented using Ice 3.0 or 3.1.
