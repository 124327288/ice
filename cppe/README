Overview
========

In order to minimize the size of Ice-E applications, two versions of
the run time library are provided:

* The "client" library is suitable for applications requiring only
  client-side functionality.

* The "server" library supports client- and server-side functionality.

A simple rule of thumb is to use the server library if your program
creates an object adapter, otherwise you can use the client library.

Users of the client library must define the preprocessor macro
ICEE_PURE_CLIENT when compiling an application as well as link with
the appropriate run time library.


Configuration
=============

You may build the Ice-E run time libraries with certain components
disabled in order to further reduce the size of your applications. The
default configuration enables all of the optional components, but you
can selectively disable them by editing the file include/IceE/Config.h
and commenting out their corresponding preprocessor macros. The
optional components are described below. For more information on these
features, please refer to the Ice manual.

Router Support
--------------

If ICEE_HAS_ROUTER is defined, the Ice-E libraries will include
support for routers. This component is necessary in order to use
Ice-E with the Glacier2 router.

Applications that use routers often also receive callbacks from remote
servers. These applications must use the server library, because the
client library does not provide support for callbacks.

Locator Support
---------------

If ICEE_HAS_LOCATOR is defined, the Ice-E libraries will include
support for locators. This component is necessary in order to use
indirect proxies in Ice-E.

Batch Messages Support
----------------------

If ICEE_HAS_BATCH is defined, the Ice-E client library will include
support for sending batch messages. This feature cannot be disabled
in the server library.


Installation
============

For installation instructions, please refer to the INSTALL.* file for
your plaftorm.
