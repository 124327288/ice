Configuration
=============

Ice-E supports a number of different configurations which alter the
size of the binaries. By default the installation enables
everything. To alter the configuration edit include/IceE/Config.h and
alter the defines at the top of the header file.

Router Support
--------------

If ICEE_HAS_ROUTER is defined Ice-E will be built with router
support. If Ice-E is built without router support then you cannot use
Ice-E with Glacier2.

Locator Support
--------------

If ICEE_HAS_LOCATOR is defined Ice-E will be built with locator
support. If Ice-E is built without locator support then you cannot use
Ice-E with indirect proxies. See the Ice Manual for more information.

Batch Messages Support
----------------------

This option only affects the pure client side library.  Batch messages
cannot be disabled on the server side. If ICEE_HAS_BATCH is defined
Ice-E will be built with batch message support. Ice-E is built without
batch support then you cannot send batch messages.

Pure Client Side Library
------------------------

The library only includes those pieces of Ice-E necessary for a pure
client. Pure clients cannot use Glacier 2. The options
ICEE_HAS_LOCATOR and ICEE_HAS_BATCH affect the size of the client side
library.  To build your application to use this library you must
define the preprocessor symbol ICEE_PURE_CLIENT when building your
application.
