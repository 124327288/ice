This demo allows you to send sequences of various types between client
and server and to measure the maximum bandwidth that can be achieved
using serialized synchronous requests.

Due to the memory constraints of WinCE, the WinCE version of this demo
uses reduced size sequences. Therefore if you wish to run cross-platform
tests against a WinCE client or server it is necessary to run with
reduced size sequences on your other platform as well. 

To start the server with reduced sequences run:

$ server --small

and likewise for the client run:

$ client --small

Failure to ensure that both client and server are using the same sequence
sizes will result in invalid output.
