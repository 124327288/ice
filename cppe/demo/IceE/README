Demos in this directory:

- MFC

  Shows how to use Ice-E in conjunction with the Microsoft Foundation
  Classes.

- bidir

  This demo shows how to use bi-directional connections for
  callbacks. This is typically used if the server cannot open a
  connection to the client to send callbacks, for example, because
  firewalls block incoming connections to the client.

- callback

  A simple callback demo that illustrates how a client can pass a
  proxy to a server, invoke an operation in the server, and the server
  call back into an object provided by the client as part of that
  invocation.

- chat

  A MFC and command line client the works with the Glacier2 chat demo
  found in the Ice distibution.

- hello

  This demo illustrates how to invoke ordinary (twoway) operations, as
  well as how to invoke oneway operations, use datagrams, secure
  invocations, and how to used batched invocations.

- latency

  A simple latency test that measures the basic call dispatch delay of
  Ice-E.

- throughput

  A simple throughput demo that allows you to send sequences of
  various types between client and server and to measure the maximum
  bandwidth that can be achieved using serialized synchronous
  requests.

- workqueue

  This application illustrates the use of the threading and
  synchronization primitives provided by the Ice-E library. It uses
  Ice-E to implement a simple producer/consumer queueing application.
