This demo provides both a command line and MFC (Windows only) client 
that operates with the Glacier2 chat demo that is located in the 
full Ice distrubution (demo/Glacier2/chat). 

First download and build the demo from the Ice distribution. 

To run the demo, first start the Ice chat server:

$ server

In a separate window, start the Ice Glacier2 router:

$ glacier2router --Ice.Config=config.glacier2

Since Ice-E does not support SSL you must first mofify the
"Glacier2.Client.Endpoints" property in config.glacier2 to use "tcp"
instead of "ssl" as the endpoint type.

Finally, start the Ice-E client. To start the command line client, run

$ client

To start the MFC client, run

$ mfcclient

Note: Ice-E must be built with router support enabled in order for this
      demo to work.
