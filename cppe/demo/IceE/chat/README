This demo provides both a command line and MFC (Windows only) client 
that operates with the Glacier2 chat demo that is located in the 
full Ice distrubution. 

To run the demo youn must first download and build the demo from the
Ice distribution and follow the instructions found there to start the
server and the Glacier2 router.

Note that since Ice-E does not support SSL you must mofify the 
"Glacier2.Client.Endpoints" property in config.glacier2 to use "tcp"
instead of "ssl" as the endpoint type.

To start the command line client, run

$ client

To start the MFC client, run

$ mfcclient
