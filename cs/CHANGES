Changes since version 1.5.1
---------------------------

- The documentation has always stated that same-named constructs
  cannot be directly nested inside each other. (For example, a
  module `M' cannot contain a constant named `M'. The slice2cs
  compiler did not enforce this correctly up to now for modules
  containing constructs with the same name as the enclosing module.
  This has been fixed and now results in a diagnostic.

- The slice2cs compiler now disallows Slice definitions at global
  scope: only modules can be defined at global scope. Everything else
  (constants, classes, interfaces, etc.) must be defined inside a
  module.

- Fixed the and slice2cs compiler for operations with multiple
  exceptions in an exception specification: if an exception was a base of one or
  more other exceptions in the same exception specification, the code
  generator sometimes emitted the catch blocks in the marshaling and
  dispatch code in the wrong order. (This applied only to interfaces
  with an ["amd"] metadata directive.)

- Several demos used Slice classes where interface were more
  appropriate. This has been fixed.

- Ice.Util.initializeWithProperties() now correctly parses the command
  line arguments.

- New properties Ice.StdErr and Ice.StdOut to redirect the standard
  error and output streams of a process.

- Added test and demo for using Ice for C# with Glacier.

- Changed the slice2cs code generator to avoid generating empty
  namespaces.

Changes since version 1.5.0
---------------------------

- Compression is now supported for non-Windows platforms as well
  as on Windows.

- Fixed a bug in the slice2cs code generator: classes with multiple
  sequence members caused incorrect code to be generated.

- Fixed a bug that sometimes prevented correct connection
  establishment under Windows.

Changes since Alpha 2
---------------------

- Added support for generating checksums of Slice definitions,
  enabling peers to verify that they share the same client-server
  contract. See the manual for more information.

- Added support for Mono.

- The DLL that contains the Ice for C# run time has been renamed from
  Icicle.dll to icecs.dll.

- Added support for protocol compression.

- Added extensive documentation for the language mapping to
  "Distributed Programming with Ice" (http://www.zeroc.com/Ice-Manual.pdf).

- Added support for AMI and AMD.

- Removed "cs:array" directive for sequences. Sequences are now mapped
  to arrays by default. If you want a sequence to map to a container
  derived from System.Collections.CollectionBase, you need to use
  the "cs:collection" metadata directive.

- Added "cs:class" metadata directive for Slice structures. Without
  this directive, Slice structures map to C# structures. With this
  directive, Slice structures map to C# classes.

- Added a key pair to the distribution so the assembly has a strong
  name and can be added to the global assembly cache. If you want to
  use your own key pair, you can replace the contents of
  src/Ice/IcecsKey.snk with your own key pair. See
  http://msdn.microsoft.com/library/default.asp?url=/library/en-us/cpguide/html/cpconcreatingkeypairforuseincreatingstrongly-namedassembly.asp
  for more detail.

- The generated code is more efficient and smaller than it was
  previously.


Changes since Alpha 1
---------------------

- Changed the generate.cs code to look for slice2cs in
  ${SolutionDir}/bin.

- Added "cs:array" metadata directive for sequences.  Sequences with
  this directive are mapped to arrays instead of being derived from
  Collections.CollectionBase.

- Improved marshaling speed.
