Changes since Alpha 1
---------------------

- Changed the generate.cs code to look for slice2cs
  in ${SolutionDir}/bin.

- Added "cs:array" metadata directive for sequences.
  Sequences with this directive are mapped to arrays
  instead of being derived from Collections.CollectionBase.

- Improved marshaling speed.
