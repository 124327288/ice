Changes since version 1.5.1
---------------------------
- New properties Ice.StdErr and Ice.StdOut to redirect the standard
  error and output streams of a process.

- Added test and demo for using Ice for C# with Glacier.

Changes since version 1.5.0
---------------------------

- Fixed a bug in the slice2cs code generator: classes with multiple
  sequence members caused incorrect code to be generated.

- Fixed a bug that sometimes prevented correct connection establishment
  under Windows.

Changes since Alpha 2
---------------------

- Added support for generating checksums of Slice definitions,
  enabling peers to verify that they share the same client-server
  contract. See the manual for more information.

- Added support for Mono.

- The DLL that contains the Ice for C# run time has been renamed from
  Icicle.dll to icecs.dll.

- Added support for protocol compression.

- Added extensive documentation for the language mapping to
  "Distributed Programming with Ice" (http://www.zeroc.com/Ice-Manual.pdf).

- Added support for AMI and AMD.

- Removed "cs:array" directive for sequences. Sequences are now mapped
  to arrays by default. If you want a sequence to map to a container
  derived from System.Collections.CollectionBase, you need to use
  the "cs:collection" metadata directive.

- Added "cs:class" metadata directive for Slice structures. Without
  this directive, Slice structures map to C# structures. With this
  directive, Slice structures map to C# classes.

- Added a key pair to the distribution so the assembly has a strong
  name and can be added to the global assembly cache. If you want to
  use your own key pair, you can replace the contents of
  src/Ice/IcecsKey.snk with your own key pair. See
  http://msdn.microsoft.com/library/default.asp?url=/library/en-us/cpguide/html/cpconcreatingkeypairforuseincreatingstrongly-namedassembly.asp
  for more detail.

- The generated code is more efficient and smaller than it was
  previously.


Changes since Alpha 1
---------------------

- Changed the generate.cs code to look for slice2cs in
  ${SolutionDir}/bin.

- Added "cs:array" metadata directive for sequences.  Sequences with
  this directive are mapped to arrays instead of being derived from
  Collections.CollectionBase.

- Improved marshaling speed.
