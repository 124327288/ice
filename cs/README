This is the Alpha 1 release of Icicle (Ice for C#).

This is a release with limited functionality. In particular,
the following features of Ice for C++ are currently not
supported:

- Asynchronous Method Invocation (AMI) and Asynchronous Method Dispatch (AMD)

- Protocol compression

- Protocol encryption

- Any of the Ice services (Freeze, Glacier, etc.)


Supported environments
----------------------

Windows only at the moment (we are working on a Mono implementation).

The code has been built and tested with Visual C# Version 7.1.3088
and .NET Framework 1.1 Version 1.1.4322.


Build instructions
------------------

Unpack the archive. The sources will be contained in the 'icicle'
subdirectory. A statically-linked Slice compiler is provided in
icicle/bin/slice2cs.exe. Open icicle/All.sln in Visual C# and build
the "All" solution (both debug and release builds are supported).

Note: The first time you build, you will most likely find that you get
errors for the "adapterDeactivationCOL" and "adapterDeactivationS"
projects. The work-around is to rebuild (not build) each project once
you have seen the errors. Thereafter, building the projects seems to
work fine. (If someone can work out why this is happening, please let
us know!)


Installation
------------

Copy the generated icicle/lib/Ice.dll file where you want it.


Running the tests
-----------------

To run the tests, you will need Python:

http://www.activestate.com/Products/ActivePython/

Run "python allTests.py" from the icicle directory to run all of the
tests, or "python allTests.py -l" to run the tests in an endless loop.

You can also run individual tests in the various test directories with
"python run.py".


Known issues
------------

- Performance is atrocious right now. (If you want to convince yourself
  of that, run the throughput demo :-)  We know about this and will fix
  it for the next release.

- There is no documentation right now. To find out how the C# language
  mapping works, have a look at the tests and demos, or look at the code
  generated by slice2cs.

Please let us know about any bugs, comments, or feedback in the Ice forum
at www.zeroc.com/vbulletin.
