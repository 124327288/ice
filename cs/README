This is the 1.5.0 release of Ice for C#.

The following features of Ice for C++ are currently not supported:

- Protocol encryption

- Any of the Ice services (Freeze, Glacier, etc.)

- Protocol compression is supported under Windows (both .NET and Mono)
  but not on other platforms. Note that, for compression to work, libbz2.dll
  must be installed and in your %PATH%. If libbz2.dll cannot be found at
  run time, the Ice run time automatically disables protocol compression.
  You can download bzip2 at http://sources.redhat.com/bzip2.

Supported environments:

- Visual C# (Windows)

- Mono (all platforms)


See INSTALL.VISUAL_C# for how to compile and install using Visual C#.
