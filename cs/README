This is the 1.6.0 release of Ice for C#.

The following features of Ice for C++ are currently not supported:

- Protocol encryption

- Any of the Ice services (Freeze, Glacier, etc.)

- Protocol compression is supported. Note that, for compression to work,
  libbz2 must be installed and in your %PATH% or $LD_LIBRARY_PATH.
  If libbz2 cannot be found at run time, the Ice run time automatically
  disables protocol compression. You can download bzip2 at
  http://sources.redhat.com/bzip2.

Supported environments:
