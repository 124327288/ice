Build instructions
------------------

The code has been built and tested with Visual C# Version 7.1.3088 and
.NET Framework 1.1 Version 1.1.4322.

Unpack the archive. The sources will be contained in the 'icecs'
subdirectory.

You can either build the slice2cs compiler from the Ice for C++ source
distribution, or you can download the Ice binary package for Windows,
which contains a compiled versions of slice2cs.  If you build slice2cs
yourself, make sure it is in your PATH or, alternatively, place
slice2cs.exe into the bin directory of the Ice for C# distribution.

Open icecs/All.sln in Visual C# and build the "All" solution (both
debug and release builds are supported).

Note: The first time you build, you will most likely find that you get
errors for the "adapterDeactivationCOL" and "adapterDeactivationS"
projects. The work-around is to rebuild (not build) each of these
projects once you have seen the errors. Thereafter, building the
projects seems to work fine. (If someone can work out why this is
happening, please let us know!)


Running the tests
-----------------

To run the tests, you will need Python:

http://www.activestate.com/Products/ActivePython/

Run "python allTests.py" from the icecs directory to run all of the
tests, or "python allTests.py -l" to run the tests in an endless loop.

You can also run individual tests in the various test directories with
"python run.py".

If you have the Mono run time installed under Windows (see
INSTALL.MONO), you can also execute the tests using the Mono run time
(instead of the .NET run time). To do this, add the -m option to
allTests.py or run.py.


Installation
------------

You can copy the generated icecs/lib/icecs.dll file where you want it
and then reference it in your appliation code.

Alternatively, you can add icecs.dll to the global assembly cache.  To
do this, open Explorer and navigate to C:\WINDOWS\assembly.  Then drag
and drop (or copy and paste) icecs.dll into the right-hand pane to
install it in the cache.

Alternatively, you can use gacutil from the command line:

    gacutil -I"path_to_icecs.dll"

Once installed in the cache, the assembly will always be located
correctly without having to set environment variables or copying it
into the directory of a .exe.


Known issues
------------

Please let us know about any bugs, comments, or feedback in the Ice
