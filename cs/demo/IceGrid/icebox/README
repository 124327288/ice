Note for Mono:

    For this demo to work properly using Mono on Linux, you must
    configure Linux to recognize Mono binaries. Configuration
    instructions are provided in INSTALL.MONO at the top level of the
    Ice for .NET source distribution or, in README at the top level of
    the Ice binary distribution (in /usr/share/doc/Ice-@ver@ if you
    have installed Ice from RPMs).

    Alternatively, if you do not want to reconfigure your kernel, or
    if you want to run with Mono under Windows, edit application.xml
    and change the icebox element to read:

    <icebox id="IceBox" exe="mono" activation="on-demand">
      <option>../../../bin/iceboxnet.exe</option>

    Note that the icebox executable is "mono", and that the actual
    icebox executable is passed as an argument to the Mono
    interpreter.

This demo shows a very simple IceGrid deployment, with a single
IceBox server hosting a number of IceBox services.

Setup
-----

Start the IceGrid registry and node with:
 $ icegridnode --Ice.Config=config.grid

Deploy the 'HelloSimpsons' application (in file application.xml) with
the IceGrid Admin graphical tool. If you prefer to use the 
command-line utility, use:
 $ icegridadmin --Ice.Config=config.grid -e \
    "application add 'application.xml'"

Running the Client
------------------

$ client.exe

The client simply calls 'sayHello' on the replicated 'hello' object.

Stopping and restarting IceBox services
---------------------------------------

You may use the IceGrid Admin graphical tool to stop and later
restart IceBox services. You can do the same with the command-line
utility; for example to stop and restart the 'Lisa' service:

$ icegridadmin --Ice.Config=config.grid
 >>> service stop IceBox Lisa
 >>> service start IceBox Lisa
