Note for Mono:

    For this demo to work properly using Mono on Linux, you must
    configure Linux to recognize Mono binaries. Configuration
    instructions are provided in INSTALL.MONO at the top level of the
    Ice for C# source distribution or, in README at the top level of
    the Ice binary distribution (in /usr/share/doc/Ice-@ver@ if you
    have installed Ice from RPMs).

    Alternatively, if you do not want to reconfigure your kernel, or
    if you want to run with Mono under Windows, edit application.xml
    and change the server element to read:

    <server id="SimpleServer" exe="mono" activation="on-demand">
      <option>./server.exe</option>

    Note that the server executable is "mono", and that the actual
    server executable is passed as an argument to the Mono
    interepreter.

To run the demo, first start the IceGrid service:

$ icegridnode --Ice.Config=config.grid

This demo contains two application descriptor files. The first descriptor,
application-single.xml, contains a single server and object. This object is
allocated by the client by using allocateById. Only one client can access this
object at a time. All other clients will hang until object is released. To 
deploy this descriptor use:

$ icegridadmin --Ice.Config=config.grid -e "application add 'application-single.xml'"

The second descriptor, application-multiple.xml, contains servers, each with an 
object. The clients retrieve these objects using allocateByType. Since there are two
objects available, two clients can get access simulaneously. Extra clients will hang
until one of the clients with an object allocated releases it. To deploy this
descriptor use:

$ icegridadmin --Ice.Config=config.grid -e "application add 'application-multiple.xml'"

To run the client type:

$ client.exe

If you have already deployed the application, you can update it to try
a different set of descriptors, for example:

$ icegridadmin --Ice.Config=config.grid -e "application update 'application-multiple.xml'"

Messages will be displayed in the IceGrid service window.
