Note for Mono:

    For this demo to work properly using Mono on Linux, you must configure
    Linux to recognize Mono binaries. Configuration instructions are
    provided in INSTALL.MONO at the top level of the Ice for C# source
    distribution or, if you have installed the demos from the Ice demo
    package, in README.DEMOS.

    Alternatively, if you do not want to reconfigure your kernel, or
    if you want to run with Mono under Windows, edit application.xml
    and change the server element to read:

    <server id="SimpleServer" exe="mono.bat" pwd="." activation="on-demand">
      <option>./server.exe</option>

    Note that the server executable is "mono.bat", and that the actual
    server executable is passed as an argument to the Mono interepreter.

To run the demo, first start the IceGrid service:

$ icegridnode --Ice.Config=config --warn

In a separate window:

$ icegridadmin --Ice.Config=config -e "application add 'application.xml'"
$ client.exe

This will deploy the application described in the file "application.xml"
and start the client.

Messages will be displayed in the IceGrid service window.

To remove the application:

$ icegridadmin --Ice.Config=config -e "application remove Simple"

To update the application with a new descriptor:

$ icegridadmin --Ice.Config=config -e "application update 'application.xml'"

You can also use the following descriptors to deploy the application:

- application_with_template.xml: 

  This descriptor demonstrates the use of templates for the server
  definition. Templates make it easy to deploy multiple instances of the
  same server. To deploy a new server based on the template, use for
  example the following command:
  
  $ icegridadmin --Ice.Config=config -e "server template instantiate \
    Simple localhost SimpleServer index=2"

  This will deploy a new server based on the `SimpleServer' template.

- application_with_replication.xml: 

  This descriptor demonstrates the use of replication to balance the
  load of the application over several servers.
