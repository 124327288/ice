Note for Mono:

    For this demo to work properly using Mono on Linux, you must configure
    Linux to recognize Mono binaries. Configuration instructions are
    provided in INSTALL.MONO at the top level of the Ice for C# source
    distribution or, if you have installed the demos from the Ice demo
    package, in README.DEMOS.

    Alternatively, if you do not want to reconfigure your kernel, or
    if you want to run with Mono under Windows, edit application.xml
    and change the server element to read:

    <server id="SimpleServer" exe="mono.bat" activation="on-demand">
      <option>./server.exe</option>

    Note that the server executable is "mono.bat", and that the actual
    server executable is passed as an argument to the Mono interepreter.

To run the demo, first start the IceGrid service:

$ icegridnode --Ice.Config=config --warn

In a separate window:

$ icegridadmin --Ice.Config=config -e "application add 'application.xml'"
$ client.exe

This will deploy the application described in the file "application.xml"
and start the client.

Messages will be displayed in the IceGrid service window.

You can also use the following descriptors to deploy the application:

- application_with_template.xml: This descriptor demonstrates the use
  of templates for the server definition. Templates make it easy to
  deploy multiple instances of the same server.

- application_with_replication.xml: This descriptor demonstrates the
  use of replication to balance the load of the application over
  several servers.

If you have already deployed the application, you can update it to try
a new descriptor, for example:

$ icegridadmin --Ice.Config=config -e "application update \ 
	'application_with_template.xml'"

When using the 'application_with_template.xml' or
'application_with_replication.xml' descriptors, you can easily deploy
more servers based on the `SimpleServer' template. For example, you
can use the following command to deploy a new server:

$ icegridadmin --Ice.Config=config -e "server template instantiate \
	Simple localhost SimpleServer index=4"
