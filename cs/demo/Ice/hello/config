# To use SSL you must enable it in the following endpoints and enable
# Ice.Plugin.IceSSL below.

# The client reads this property to create the reference to the
# "hello" object in the server.

Hello.Proxy=hello:tcp -p 10000:udp -p 10000#:ssl -p 10001

#
# The server creates one single object adapter with the name
# "Hello". The following line sets the endpoints for this
# adapter.
