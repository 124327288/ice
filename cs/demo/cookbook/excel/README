This demo illustrates how to embed an Ice client in an Excel
spreadsheet.

The demo requires Excel 2007 and Visual Studio 2008 or later, and it
uses the Ice Visual Studio plug-in which you can download from

  http://www.zeroc.com/vsplugin.html

Build the three projects for the demo, then start the server from a
command shell:

> server.exe --Ice.Config=config.server

To run the client, right-click on the cookbook.excel.client project
and select "Debug->Start new instance".

When the worksheet is opened, the client fills the employee cells with
the name and address retrieved from the server. You can now add the
salary for each employ in column C, and Excel calculates the tax and
displays it in column D.

When you close the worksheet, Excel contacts the server and sets the
salary and tax for each employee in the server. (The server prints some
trace to show this.)
