A simple WCF throughput demo that allows you to send sequences of various
types between client and server and to measure the maximum bandwidth
that can be achieved using serialized synchronous requests.

To run the demo, first start the server:

$ server.exe

In a separate window, start the client:

$ client.exe

By default, the client and server use the loopback interface (127.0.0.1).
You can specify a different interface on the command line, for example:

$ server.exe 192.168.4.2

$ client.exe 192.168.4.2

By default server listens on port 10001 for binary messages,
and on port 10002 for SOAP messages. You can specify different
ports on the command line:

$ server.exe serverhost.xyz.com 11111 11112

$ client.exe serverhost.xyz.com 11111 11112

Under Vista, you must run the server as administrator.
