This directory contains demos for the various parts of Ice. The demos
are provided to get you started on how to use a particular feature or
coding technique. See the README file in each subdirectory for details
on the various demos.

The book directory contains demos for some of the code examples
in "Distributed Programming with Ice".

If you run the demos with Mono on Linux, the instructions assume that
you have configured your kernel to automatically execute the Mono
interpreter. To do this, run the following commands as root
(replace /opt/mono/bin/mono with the location of your mono interpreter):

    if [ ! -e /proc/sys/fs/binfmt_misc/register ]; then
	/sbin/modprobe binfmt_misc mount -t binfmt_misc none /proc/sys/fs/binfmt_misc
    fi 
    if [ -e /proc/sys/fs/binfmt_misc/register ]; then
	echo ':CLR:M::MZ::/usr/bin/mono:' > /proc/sys/fs/binfmt_misc/register
    else
	echo "No binfmt_misc support" exit 1
    fi
