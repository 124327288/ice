This demo allows you to send sequences of various types between client
and server and to measure the maximum bandwidth that can be achieved
using serialized synchronous requests.

It is possible to run this demo with reduced-size sequences on platforms
that may have memory constraints that make the full-size sequences 
unusable.

To start the server with reduced sequences, use this command:

$ java Server --small

Similarly, use this command for the client:

$ java Client --small

Failure to ensure that both client and server are using the same
sequence sizes will result in invalid output.
