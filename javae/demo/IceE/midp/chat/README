This demo provides a MIDlet client that communicates with the Glacier2
chat demo provided in the full Ice distribution (in the directory
demo/Glacier2/chat). You must build the Ice demo before you can run
this client.

To run the demo, change to the Ice demo directory and start the chat
server:

$ server

In a separate window, change to the Ice demo directory and modify
the file config.glacier2 to replace "ssl" with "tcp" in the property
Glacier2.Client.Endpoints.

Next, start the Glacier2 router:

$ glacier2router --Ice.Config=config.glacier2

Finally, start the MIDlet. To run it in the WTK emulator, do the
following:

$ emulator -Xdescriptor:ChatDemo.jad
