# TODO: We need a good description of what needs to be done here. Either that
# or MIDlets could use a different sort of configuration for proxies, such as
# separate entries for host, port and timeout and the proxy is constructed out
# of that.  For a MIDlet, the hostname almost certainly needs to be specified.
#

#
# Set Test.Host to the hostname or IP address for the server host.

Test.Host=localhost
