Changes since version 1.1.0
---------------------------

- Removed getDefaultProperties() method, and the global default
  properties. If you need global properties, you can easily
  create your own global variable.

- Added new createProperties() methods:
  public static Properties
  createProperties(StringSeqHolder args, Properties defaults)
  public static Properties
  createProperties(String[] args, Properties defaults)
 
  "defaults" represents an optional set of default properties
  used to initialize the new Properties object. Ice properties 
  defined on the command-line and properties defined in the Ice
  config file may override these default properties.
   
- Added a new communicator-initialization method:
  public static Communicator
  initialize(InitializationData initData)

- Added identityToString and stringToIdentity to the Communicator
  interface.

- It is now permissible to recreate a new object adapter with the same 
  name as an old adapter once waitForDeactivate() has returned on the
  old adapter.

- Added new method Ice::Communicator::createObjectAdapterWithRouter()
  which creates a routed object adapter. A object adapter can now only
  have one router associated with it, which is set with using this 
  method or by setting the <AdapterName>.Router property.  Also 
  as a result of this the Ice::ObjectAdapter::addRouter() and
  Ice::ObjectAdapter::removeRouter() methods have been removed.

- Added communicator initialize method which takes a InitializationData
  structure containing communicator members which are only allowed
  to be set during communicator creation. Currently included are
  Properties, Logger, and default context. The initializeWith
  communicator initialization functions have been deprecated and the
  setLogger() and setDefaultContext() methods have been removed.

- Added requestId to Current.

Changes since version 1.0.0
---------------------------

- If several proxies share the same connection, and an operation call
  on one of the proxies causes a failure and the shared connection to
  be closed, then subsequent calls on the other proxies will try to
  establish a new connection instead of throwing an exception, even if
  retries are disabled.

- Added blocking client side concurrency model. The use of this model is
  controlled by the Ice.Blocking property.

- Fixed bug in identityToString() and proxyToString() that could cause
  incorrect string values to be returned for identities containing
  characters outside the ASCII range.

- The contents of the default context set on a communicator were
  ignored, so an empty default context was marshaled. Fixed this.

- Fixed a bug in the Slice parser that caused problems if an included
  file contained white space in the file name.

- Fixed a deadlock during shutdown that could happen with
  bi-directional connections.

- Removed ice_default() method from proxies.

- Connection::close(false) (i.e., graceful connection shutdown) now
  waits until all outstanding requests have completed.

- Ice.Communicator.createObjectAdapter() throws
  Ice.AlreadyRegisteredException if it is called with the name of an
  object adapter that already exists.
