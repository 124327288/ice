Changes since version 1.0.0
---------------------------

- Fixed a deadlock during shutdown that could happen with
  bi-directional connections.

- Removed ice_default() method from proxies.

- Connection::close(false) (i.e., graceful connection shutdown) now
  waits until all outstanding requests have completed.

- Ice.Communicator.createObjectAdapter() throws
  Ice.AlreadyRegisteredException if it is called with the name of an
  object adapter that already exists.
