# Ice Test Suite Certificates

This directory contains the certificates used by the Ice Test Suite. These
certificates are for testing puproses only and should **never** be used in a
production environment.

## Generating New Certificates

The `makecerts.py` script can be used to generate a new set of certificates for
a specific DNS name and IP address.
