To run this demo, you need the client from the equivalent Ice for C++
demo. No Java client is supported at this time, because the client
uses the C/C++ tools "flex" and "bison".

Open three terminal windows. In the first window, start the server:

$ java Server

In the second window, run the Glacier starter:

$ glacierstarter --Ice.Config=config

In the third window, run the C++ client:

$ <path_to_c++_client>/client

You will be asked for a userid and a password. Any userid/password
combination with the password being the same as the userid will be
accepted (for example, userid="test" and password="test").
