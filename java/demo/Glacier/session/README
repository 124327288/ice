To run this demo, open three terminal windows. In the first window,
start the server:

$ java Server

In the second window, run the Glacier starter (see NOTE below):

$ glacierstarter --Ice.Config=config

In the third window, run the client:

$ java Client

These commands require the "Ice.jar" file and the local subdirectory
"classes" to be in your CLASSPATH.

You will be asked for a userid and a password. Any userid/password
combination with the password being the same as the userid will be
accepted (for example, userid="test" and password="test").

If no data is received from the client for a period of 60 seconds 
(this timeout is configurable) the glacier session will be terminated.
In order to send more data, you will need to start a new session by
restarting the client and logging in again.

NOTE: The glacierstarter executable is not currently available on
Windows. You can still use this demo if you have a supported platform
on which to run glacierstarter.
