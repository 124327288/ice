To run the demo:

Start the IceStorm service:

$ icebox --Ice.Config=config.icebox

This configuration assumes there is a subdirectory named db in the
current working directory.

In a separate window:

$ java Subscriber

In another window:

$ java Publisher

While the publisher continues to run "tick" messages should be
displayed in the subscriber window.
