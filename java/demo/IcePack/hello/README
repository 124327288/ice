The IcePack node starts Java server processes, therefore prior to
starting the node you must set the CLASSPATH environment variable
to contain at least Ice.jar and the classes subdirectory, as shown
in the Unix example below:

$ export CLASSPATH=<Ice-directory>/lib/Ice.jar:classes

To run the demo, first start the IcePack service:

$ icepacknode --Ice.Config=config --warn

In a separate window:

$ icepackadmin --Ice.Config=config -e "application add 'application.xml'"
$ java Client

This will deploy the servers described in the file "application.xml"
and start the client.

Messages will be displayed in the IcePack service window.

The deployment descriptors contain a "debug" target that configures
the application to display additional tracing information. To deploy
the application with this target, include the "debug" target on the
command line as shown below:

$ icepackadmin --Ice.Config=config -e "application add 'application.xml' debug"

If you have already deployed your application, you can update it with
the following command:

$ icepackadmin --Ice.Config=config -e "application update 'application.xml' debug"
