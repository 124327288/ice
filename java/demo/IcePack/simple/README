The IcePack node starts Java server processes, therefore prior to
starting the node you must set the CLASSPATH environment variable to
contain at least Ice.jar and the classes subdirectory, as shown in the
Unix example below:

$ export CLASSPATH=<Ice-directory>/lib/Ice.jar:classes

To run the demo, first start the IcePack service:

$ icepacknode --Ice.Config=config --warn

In a separate window:

$ icepackadmin --Ice.Config=config -e "application add 'application.xml'"
$ java Client

This will deploy the servers described in the file "application.xml"
and start the client.

Messages will be displayed in the IcePack service window.
