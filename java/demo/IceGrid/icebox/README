This demo shows a very simple IceGrid deployment, with a single
IceBox server hosting a number of IceBox services.


Setup
-----

Start the IceGrid registry and node:

 $ icegridnode --Ice.Config=config.grid

Deploy the 'HelloSimpsons' application (in file application.xml) with
the IceGrid Admin graphical tool. If you prefer to use the 
command-line utility, use:

 $ icegridadmin --Ice.Config=config.grid -e \
    "application add application.xml"


Using the IceGrid GUI
---------------------

We suggest using the graphical IceGrid administration tool with this
demo. Follow these steps to log into the IceGrid registry and view
the application you deployed above:

  - Launch the application. Windows users can double-click on the
    file IceGridGUI.jar located in <Ice installation directory>\bin.
    Users with a Linux RPM installation can use a script to start the
    program:

    $ icegridgui

    On other platforms, start it from a command window as follows:

    $ java -jar IceGridGUI.jar

    The location of the JAR file varies by platform; for a Linux RPM
    installation, the file resides in /usr/share/java. On other
    platforms it can be found in <Ice installation directory>/lib.

  - Select Login... from the File menu.

  - Enter any username and password combination (the password is not
    validated).

  - Enter "DemoIceGrid" for the IceGrid instance name.

  - Enter "tcp -h localhost -p 4061" for the endpoints.

  - Click OK to log in.


Running the Client
------------------

$ java Client

The client simply calls 'sayHello' on the replicated 'hello' object.


Stopping and restarting IceBox services
---------------------------------------

You can use the IceGrid GUI or the command-line utility to stop and
restart IceBox services. The commands below show how to manipulate
the 'Lisa' service:

 $ icegridadmin --Ice.Config=config.grid
 >>> service stop IceBox Lisa
 >>> service start IceBox Lisa
