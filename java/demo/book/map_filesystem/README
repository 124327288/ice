This demo presents an implementation of the filesystem
application based on a Freeze map, as discussed in
the Freeze chapter of the Ice manual.

To run it, start the server in a window:

$ java Server

Then run the client in a separate window:

$ java Client

Type "help" at the client prompt to see a list of commands.
