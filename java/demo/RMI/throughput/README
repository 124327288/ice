A simple RMI throughput demo that allows you to send sequences of various
types between client and server and to measure the maximum bandwidth
that can be achieved using serialized synchronous requests.

To run the demo, start the RMI registry:

$ rmiregistry

In a separate window, start the server:

$ java -Djava.rmi.server.hostname=127.0.0.1 -Djava.rmi.server.codebase=file:/c:/path/to/ice/java/demo/RMI/throughput/classes/ -Djava.security.policy=policy Server

You need to edit the path on the command line to specify this directory.
Under Vista, you must run the server as administrator.

In a separate window, start the client:

$ client.exe --Djava.security.policy=policy Client

If you want to run client and server on different machines, you
can specify the hsot on which you started the registry on
the client's command line, for example:

$ client.exe --Djava.security.policy=policy Client 192.168.4.2

This directs the client to connect to the registry at the specified IP address.
