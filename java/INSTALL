This distribution contains the Ice for Java source code, class files,
and HTML reference material. The following sections describe the
requirements for using Ice for Java and provide instructions for
installing it.

======================================================================
Requirements
======================================================================


Operating systems
-----------------

Ice for Java has been tested under Linux and Windows 2000/XP, but due
to the portability of Java, it is very likely that it will also work
on other platforms for which a suitable Java implementation is
available.

Note, however, that you will need the Slice to Java translator (see
below), which is only available for Linux and Windows 2000/XP. For
other platforms, you will have to either port Ice for C++ (which
contains the Slice to Java translator), or you will have to translate
Slice to Java on a Linux or Windows XP/2000 machine, and copy the
resulting Java files to your target platform.


Java version
------------

Ice for Java requires Java version 1.4.1 or later. Older versions are
not supported, because Ice makes use of the new java.nio packages.
(java.nio was introduced in version 1.4.0, but was broken on Windows.)

You can download the Java 2 Platform, Standard Edition from
http://java.sun.com/j2se/.

Make sure to add javac and java to your PATH.


Slice to Java translator
------------------------

You will need the Slice to Java translator and supporting executables
and libraries. You can download a pre-compiled archive from our FTP
server, or you can build Ice for C++ yourself.

The pre-compiled archives are available for Linux and Windows 2000/XP:

Linux:             ftp://ftp.zeroc.com/pub/Ice/1.0/Ice-1.0.0-bin-linux.tar.gz
Windows 2000/XP:   ftp://ftp.zeroc.com/pub/Ice/1.0/Ice-1.0.0-bin-win32.zip

After downloading an archive, extract it into a directory of your
choosing, and add the 'bin' subdirectory to your PATH.


Other Ice utilities
-------------------

Some of the Ice for Java tests and demonstration programs require
additional Ice for C++ utilities, such as IcePack and Glacier. The
pre-compiled archives listed above contain only a subset of the
Ice for C++ utilities, for space reasons. Therefore, not all Ice
for Java tests can be run without building Ice for C++ yourself.


Berkeley DB
-----------

Freeze for Java uses Berkeley DB as its underlying database. Even
though Berkeley DB is included with many Linux distributions, the Java
files for Berkeley DB are usually not available. This means that you
must build Berkeley DB manually.

You can download Berkeley DB from:

http://www.sleepycat.com/download.html

When you build Berkeley DB, make sure to configure Berkeley DB with
Java support. For Linux, this is done by specifying --enable-java with
"configure". For Windows 2000/XP, you must select the "db_java --
Win32 Release" project. For details, please see:

http://www.sleepycat.com/docs/index.html

Make sure to add db.jar to your CLASSPATH.


Python 2
--------

To run the automated test suite, you will need Python 2. If you have
no interest in running the test scripts, Python is not required.
Linux distributions usually include Python. For Windows 2000/XP, you
can download a Python distribution from:

http://www.activestate.com


======================================================================
Testing
======================================================================

You can run the Ice for Java test suite, provided that you have
installed Python 2:

python allTests.py

Note that on some Linux distributions (like Redhat 7.x), Python 2 is
available as "python2", in which case you must use:

python2 allTests.py

If everything worked out, you should see lots of "ok". In case of a
failure, the tests abort with "failed".

If you want to try out any of the demos, make sure to add lib/Ice.jar
to your CLASSPATH.


======================================================================
Compiling the Source
======================================================================

There is generally no need to compile Ice for Java, because this
distribution already contains the class files for the Ice core,
Ice services, examples and tests.

If you want to rebuild the source code, you will need the 'ant'
utility, which is available here:

http://ant.apache.org/

After installing ant, run the following commands to completely
rebuild the Ice for Java source code:

$ ant clean
$ ant


======================================================================
Installation
======================================================================

No automatic installation for Ice for Java is supported. Simply copy
the Ice.jar file from the lib directory to the directory of your
choice, and then add Ice.jar to your CLASSPATH.
