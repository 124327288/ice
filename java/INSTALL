Requirements
======================================================================


Operating systems
-----------------

Ice for Java has been tested under Linux and Windows 2000/XP, but due
to the portability of Java, it is very likely that it will also work
on other platforms.

Note, however, that you require the Slice to Java translators (see
below), which are only available as binaries for Linux and Windows
2000/XP. For other platforms, you will have to either port Ice for C++
(which contains the Slice to Java translators), or you will have to
translate Slice to Java on a Linux or Windows XP/2000 machine, and
copy the resulting Java files to your target platform.


Java version
------------

Ice for Java requires Java version 1.4.1 or later. Older versions are
not supported, because Ice makes use of the new java.nio packages.
(java.nio was introduced in version 1.4.0, but was broken on Windows.)

You can download the Java 2 Platform, Standard Edition from
http://java.sun.com/j2se/.

Make sure to add javac and java to your PATH.


Ant
---

Ice for Java uses Ant as build system. You can download Ant from:

http://jakarta.apache.org/ant/

Make sure to add ant to your PATH.


Slice to Java translators
-------------------------

You require the binary packages to translate Slice to Java. You can
download the binary packages from our FTP server:

Linux:             ftp://ftp.zeroc.com/TBD
Windows 2000/XP:   ftp://ftp.zeroc.com/TBD

Another option is to build Ice for C++, which includes the Slice
to Java translators.

Add the Slice to Java translators to your PATH.


Other Ice utilities
-------------------

Some of the Ice for Java tests and demonstration programs require
additional Ice for C++ utilities, such as IcePack or Glacier. The
binaries for these utilities are included in the Slice to Java
translator binary packages above. Alternatively, you can build Ice
for C++ from source to get these utilities.


Berkeley DB
-----------

Freeze for Java uses Berkeley DB as its underlying database. Even
though Berkeley DB is included with many Linux distributions, the Java
files for Berkeley DB are usually not available. This means that you
must build Berkeley DB manually.

You can download Berkeley DB from:

http://www.sleepycat.com/download.html

When you build Berkeley DB, make sure to configure Berkeley DB with
Java support. For Linux, this is done by specifying --enable-java with
"configure". For Windows 2000/XP, you must select the "db_java --
Win32 Release" project. For details, please see:

http://www.sleepycat.com/docs/index.html

Make sure to add db.jar to your CLASSPATH.


Python 2
--------

To run the automated test suite, you will need Python 2. If you have
no interest in running the test scripts, Python is not required.
Linux distributions usually include Python. For Windows 2000/XP, you
can download a Python distribution from:

http://www.activestate.com


======================================================================
Compilation and Testing
======================================================================

Extract the Ice for Java archive in any directory you like (for
example, in your home directory), then compile Ice for Java with the
command "ant". This will build the Ice for Java core library, all
add-ons, all tests, and all examples. After a successful build, you
can run the test suite, provided that you have installed Python 2:

python allTests.py

Note that on some Linux distributions (like Redhat 7.x), Python 2 is
available as "python2", in which case you must use:

python2 allTests.py

If everything worked out, you should see lots of "ok". In case of a
failure, the tests abort with "failed".

If you want to try out any of the demos, make sure to add the "lib"
directory to your CLASSPATH.


======================================================================
Installation
======================================================================

No automatic installation for Ice for Java is supported. Simply copy
the Ice.jar file from the lib directory to the directory of your
choice, and then add Ice.jar to your CLASSPATH.
