Ice for Java uses Apache Ant for its build system. Ant can be
downloaded here:

http://jakarta.apache.org/ant/index.html

To build Ice for Java, run 'ant' without any arguments. To run
the equivalent of 'make clean', run 'ant clean'. The build system
expects the slice2java executable to be in your PATH.

Note that the control file for ant is build.xml.
