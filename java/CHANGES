Changes since version 1.0.1
---------------------------

- The connection timeout is now also used when connections are
  closed. This avoid hanging processes if the peer misbehaves.

- In some cases, communicator destruction could result in a
  java.lang.NullPointerException. This has been fixed. Now a
  CommunicatorDestroyedException is raised.

- Fixed a bug with AMD methods using a servant locator, such as the
  Freeze evictor.

- Changed the generated equals() method to use the helper
  java.util.Arrays.equals() when comparing sequences, rather than the
  native array equals() method. This means the equals() method for a
  type containing a sequence member will perform a deep comparison of
  the sequence.

- Added timestamps to the default Ice logger. You can enable
  timestamps by setting the `Ice.Logger.Timestamp' property to a value
  larger than zero. By default timestamps are disabled.

- Improved IceBox service deactivation. Instead of successively
  stoping a service and destroying its communicator, services are now
  all stopped first and then their communicators are destroyed.

- Modified the Ice protocol to fix a problem with compression. The
  message types for compressed messages have been removed, and a field
  has been added to the message header indicating compression status.

- Added version negotiation to the Ice protocol. This permits future
  protocol extensions to be added without breaking interoperability
  with older deployed clients and servers. Unfortunately, doing this
  broke compatibility with the existing protocol so, when upgrading to
  this version, you must make sure that clients and servers use the
  same version of Ice.jar.

- Added a magic number to the Ice protocol. All Ice protocol messages
  have 'I', 'c', 'e', 'P' (encoded as ASCII) in the first four bytes.
  This is useful to allow protocol analyzers to recognize Ice
  messages.

- Changed the encoding of encapsulations. An encapsulation now looks
  like:

	size (4 bytes)
	major version number (1 byte)
	minor version number (1 byte)
	data (n bytes)

  The size includes the count of bytes for the size and versions, so
  the value of size is n + 6.

- Added -v and -e options to stringified UDP endpoints. -v sets the
  protocol version and -e sets the encoding version. (The current
  version for both protocol and encoding is 1.0.)

Changes since version 1.0.0
---------------------------

- Fixed a bug in the ObjectAdapter which caused it to ignore all but
  the first endpoint.

- Fixed a bug with throwing exceptions in AMD calls after invoking
  ice_response().

- Fixed a bug with throwing exceptions in AMI from within
  ice_response().
