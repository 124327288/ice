Changes since version 1.0.1
---------------------------

- Added version negotiation to the Ice protocol. This permits future protocol
  extensions to be added without breaking interoperability with older
  deployed clients and servers. Unfortunately, doing this broke compatibility
  with the existing protocol so, when upgrading to this version, you must
  make sure that clients and servers use the same version of Ice.jar.

- Added a magic number to the Ice protocol. All Ice protocol messages
  have 'I', 'c', 'e', 'P' (encoded as ASCII) in the first four bytes.
  This is useful to allow protocol analyzers to recognize Ice messages.

- Changed the encoding of encapsulations. An encapsulation now looks like:

	size (4 bytes)
	major version number (1 byte)
	minor version number (1 byte)
	data (n bytes)

  The size includes the count of bytes for the size and versions, so
  the value of size is n + 6.

- Added -v and -e options to stringified UDP endpoints. -v sets the
  protocol version and -e sets the encoding version. (The current
  version for both protocol and encoding is 1.0.)

Changes since version 1.0.0
---------------------------

- Fixed a bug in the ObjectAdapter which caused it to ignore all but the
  first endpoint.

- Fixed a bug with throwing exceptions in AMD calls after invoking
  ice_response().

- Fixed a bug with throwing exceptions in AMI from within
  ice_response().
