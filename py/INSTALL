- Ice 1.6.0

Building the Ice extension for Python (Linux/Solaris/HP-UX/MacOS X/AIX)
=========================================================================

Follow these steps to build the Ice extension for Python:

1) Edit config/Make.rules and modify the installation prefix if
   necessary.

2) Execute 'python -V' to verify that the Python 2.3 interpreter
   is in your executable search path.

3) Run 'make'.

4) Upon successful completion, run 'make install'. You may need
   additional user priveleges to install in the directory specified
   by config/Make.rules.

5) Modify your PYTHONPATH environment variable to include the Ice
   for Python extension. Assuming you installed the extension in
   the default directory (/opt/IcePy-1.6.0), you would modify your
   environment as shown below:

   export ICEPY_HOME=/opt/IcePy-1.6.0
   export PYTHONPATH=$ICEPY_HOME/lib:$ICEPY_HOME/python:$PYTHONPATH

Running the Tests
=========================================================================

TBD

The test subdirectory contains PHP implementations of the core Ice
test suite. In order to run these tests, you must have Python 2.2
or later, and the Ice for C++ tests must be built in the directory
specified by the ICE_HOME environment variable.

The test scripts require that the CLI version of the PHP interpreter
be available in your PATH, and assume that the Ice extension was
built in a static configuration.

To run all of the tests, do the following:

$ python allTests.py

You can also run tests individually by changing to the test directory
and running this command:

$ python run.py

In order to run the tests using a dynamic Ice extension, you will
need to edit the php.ini files in each test directory and add the
following configuration directives:

extension_dir=<phpdir>/modules
extension=ice.so
