Demos in this directory:

- callback

  A simple callback demo that illustrates how a client can pass a proxy to
  a server, invoke an operation in the server, and the server call back
  into an object provided by the client as part of that invocation.

- hello

  This demo illustrates how to invoke ordinary (twoway) operations, as well
  as how to invoke oneway operations, use datagrams, secure invocations, and
  how to used batched invocations.

- latency

  A simple latency test that measures the basic call dispatch delay of Ice.

- throughput

  A simple throughput demo that allows you to send byte sequences between
  client and server and to measure the maximum bandwidth that can be
  achieved with Ice.

- value

  This demo shows how to use classes, class factories, and the difference
  between local and remote invocations of class operations.
