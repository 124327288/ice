Creating DEB packages for Ice
=============================

This file describes how to create source and binary DEBs for Ice as a
regular (non-root) user on your Ubuntu Linux system.

  1. Setup the packaging software
  2. Install ZeroC Ice DEB repository
  3. Install Ice third-party dependencies
  4. Building the Ice packages


======================================================================
1. Setup the packaging software
======================================================================

First we will install all the tools needed to build the Ice packages
in your Ubuntu system.

$ sudo apt-get install packaging-dev


======================================================================
2. Install ZeroC Ice DEB repository
======================================================================

Some of the third-party packages required to build Ice are not
available through Ubuntu repositories, so you need to add the ZeroC
Ice repository to be able to install these packages.

First you need to install the GPG key used to sign the packages:

  $ wget http://www.zeroc.com/download/RPM-GPG-KEY-zeroc-release
  $ sudo apt-key add RPM-GPG-KEY-zeroc-release

After installing the GPG key, we must add the repository to your
system apt sources:

  $ cd /etc/apt/sources.list.d
  $ sudo wget http://zeroc.com/download/Ice/@mmver@/ubuntu/ice@mmver@-trusty.list
  $ sudo apt-get update


======================================================================
3. Install Ice third-party dependencies
======================================================================

Now we will install the necessary third-party packages from the Ubuntu
Software repository:

  sudo apt-get install libmcpp-dev libbz2-dev libexpat1-dev libssl-dev \
    libdb5.3++-dev libdb5.3-java ant python2.7-dev ruby1.9.1-dev \
    php5-dev

A Java Development Kit is also required. We recommend that you use
Oracle Java 7 to build Ice because the Metrics Graph feature of the
IceGrid Administrative console requires JavaFX. If you build Ice using
another Java 7 JDK, or any Java 6 JDK, the Metrics Graph functionality
will not be available.

Note: The resulting JAR files produced by the build are compatible
regardless of the JDK you use.

There are several ways to get Oracle Java 7 installed in Ubuntu, but
the simplest is to use the webupd8team ppa repository:

  sudo add-apt-repository ppa:webupd8team/java
  sudo apt-get update
  sudo apt-get install oracle-java7-installer
  sudo apt-get install oracle-java7-set-default


======================================================================
4. Building the Ice packages
======================================================================

Install the Ice @ver@ source distribution:

  $ mkdir ~/ice@mmver@
  $ cd ~/ice@mmver@
  $ apt-get source ice@mmver@

Change the working directory to ice@mmver@-@ver@:

  $ cd ice@mmver@-@ver@

Now you're ready to build Ice packages:

  $ dpkg-buildpackage -us -uc

When finished, the .deb files will be in the ice@mmver@ directory.
