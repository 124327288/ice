Description
-----------

The Ice Visual Studio Extension allows integration of Ice projects
into the Visual Studio IDE. The extension supports C++, .NET, and
Silverlight projects.


Activating the plug-in for a project
------------------------------------

After installing the plug-in, right-click on the project in
Solution Explorer and choose "Ice Configuration..." or go to 
"Ice Configuration..." in the "Tools" menu. This opens a dialog where
you can configure Ice build properties.

Note that after adding new configurations or platforms to your
project, it may be necessary to disable and then re-enable the plug-in
in order for the new configuration/platform to get the correct Ice
settings.


Project properties
------------------

  * Ice Home
  
    Set the directory where Ice is installed.

  * Slice Compiler Options

    Tick the corresponding check boxes to pass options such as --ice,
    --stream, --checksum, or --tie (.NET only) to the Slice compiler.

    Tick "Console Output" if you want compiler output to appear in 
    Output window.

  * Extra Compiler Options
  
    Add extra Slice compiler options that are not explicitly supported
    above.

    These options must be entered the same as they would be on the command
    line to the Slice compiler. For example, preprocessor macros can be
    defined by entering the following:

    -DFOO -DBAR

  * Slice Include Path
  
    Set the list of directories to search for included Slice files
    (-I option).
    
    The checkbox for each path specifies whether the path should be
    relative to the project directory or an absolute path. Note that
    paths that use environment variables are not changed by this
    feature.  

  * DLL Export Symbol (C++ only)

    Set the symbol to use for DLL exports (--dll-export option).

  * Ice Components
  
    Set the list of Ice libraries to link with.

Environment Variables
---------------------

The "Ice Home", "Extra Compiler Options" and "Slice Include Path"
settings all allow environment variables to be specified. To do this
the environment variable must be entered using $(VAR) as the format.
For example, for the "Ice Home" you could use $(ICE_HOME).


Adding Slice files to a project
-------------------------------

Use "Add -> New Item..." to create a Slice file and add it to a project.
Use "Slice File (.ice)" as the file type. To add an existing Slice file,
use "Add -> Existing Item...".


Generating code
---------------

The extension compiles a Slice file whenever you save the file. The
extension tracks dependencies among Slice files in the project
and recompiles only those files that require it after a change.

Generated files are automatically added to the project. For example,
for Demo.ice, the extension for C++ adds Demo.cpp and Demo.h to the
project, whereas the extension for C# adds Demo.cs to the project.

Slice Compilation errors are displayed in the Visual Studio "Output"
and "Error List" panels.


VC++ Pre-compiled headers
-------------------------

For C++ projects, pre-compiled headers are detected automatically.
(The extension automatically passes the required --add-header option
to slice2cpp.)

If you change the pre-compiled header setting of a project, you must
rebuild the project.
