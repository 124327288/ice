Changes since version 2.0.0
---------------------------

- Overloaded the checkedCast member function of the generated PrxHelper
  classes to allow a trailing argument of type ::Ice::Context. This makes
  it possible to do stateful things that require a context in a
  servant locator's activate() method.

- Fixed a bug in slice2vb: incorrect code was generated if
  an interface was derived from a base interface in a different
  module if the base interface contained a AMD operation.
