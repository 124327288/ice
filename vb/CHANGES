Changes since version 2.1.0
---------------------------

- Added -E option to the various Slice compilers to print preprocessor
  output on stdout.

- Fixed a bug in the option parsing for Ice tools such as slice2cpp,
  slice2java, slice2cs, etc. The option parser used to incorrectly
  complain about repeated options when in fact no option was
  repeated. Also changed the parser to permit options to follow an
  argument, so

      slice2cpp -I. x.ice

  and

      slice2cpp x.ice -I.

  are now equivalent.

Changes since version 2.0.0
---------------------------

- Fixed bug in the code generators for C# and VB: for sequences
  of structs and sequences of Object*, incorrect code was generated
  if a ["cs:collection"] or ["vb:collection"] metadata directive
  was used.

- Added setDefaultContext() and getDefaultContext() to the
  Ice::Communicator interface. This allows a default context to be
  established on a communicator-wide basis. See section 29.8.3 in the
  doc.

  Added ice_defaultContext to Ice::ObjectProxy. This creates a new
  proxy that uses the default context established on the communicator.

- Overloaded the checkedCast member function of the generated PrxHelper
  classes to allow a trailing argument of type Ice::Context. This makes
  it possible to do stateful things that require a context in a
  servant locator's activate() method.

- Fixed a bug in slice2vb: incorrect code was generated if an interface
  was derived from a base interface in a different module if the base
  interface contained a AMD operation.
