Build instructions
------------------

The code has been built and tested with:

- Microsoft Visual Studio 2005 Version 8.0.50727.42 and .NET Framework
  Version 2.0.50727.

Unpack the archive. The sources will be contained in the IceVB-@ver@
subdirectory.

Add the directory containing slice2cs to the list of "Executable
files" directories in Visual Studio:

- In the IDE, choose Tools->Options->Projects->VC++ Directories

- Select "Executable files"

- Add <Ice installation root directory>\bin

Alternatively, you can set the environment variable ICE_HOME to the
location of your Ice installation root directory.

To use Visual Basic (or other .NET languages) with Ice, you need
the run-time support provided by the Ice for C# assembly
(icecs.dll). The Ice for Visual Basic build environment expects
icecs.dll to be installed in $(solutiondir)\..\IceCS-@ver@\bin.
Alternatively, you can install icecs.dll in the Global Assembly Cache
(GAC). If you have installed the Ice binary distribution for Windows,
the icecs.dll assembly has already been installed in the GAC. If you
prefer to install the assembly in the GAC yourself, refer to the
INSTALL file included with the Ice for C# source distribution for
instructions.

To compile your Slice definitions, you need to use slice2cs to generate
C# source code and use a C# compiler to compile the generated code into
a DLL. Then reference that DLL from your Visual Basic project.

See the Ice Manual and the makefiles and Visual Studio projects included
with the demos for more information.


Building with Visual Basic 2005
-------------------------------

Open All.sln in Visual Basic and build the solution. (Both release
and debug builds are supported.)
