Demos in this directory:

- bidir

  This demo shows how to use bi-directional connections for
  callbacks. This is typically used if the server cannot open a
  connection to the client to send callbacks, for example, because
  firewalls block incoming connections to the client.

- callback

  A simple callback demo that illustrates how a client can pass a proxy to
  a server, invoke an operation in the server, and the server call back
  into an object provided by the client as part of that invocation.

- hello

  This demo illustrates how to invoke ordinary (twoway) operations, as well
  as how to invoke oneway operations, use datagrams, secure invocations, and
  how to used batched invocations.

- invoke

  This demo illustrates the use of the Ice streaming API.

- latency

  A simple latency test that measures the basic call dispatch delay of Ice.

- nested

  A demo to illustrate how nested callbacks work, and how the size of the
  thread pool affects the maximum nesting depth.

- throughput

  A simple throughput demo that allows you send byte sequences between
  client and server and to measure the maximum bandwidth that can be
  achieved with Ice.

- value

  This demo shows how to use classes, class factories, and the difference
  between local and remote invocations of class operations.
