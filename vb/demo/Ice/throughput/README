A simple throughput demo that allows you to send sequences of various
types between client and server and to measure the maximum bandwidth
that can be achieved using serialized synchronous requests.

To run the demo, first start the server:

$ server

In a separate window, start the client:

$ client

The performance for byte sequences is expected to be greater than 
for other types, because the cost of marshaling and unmarshaling 
is greater for more complex types, also with byte sequences there
isn't need to allocate/dellocate objects witch could be expesive.
