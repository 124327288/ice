

The following fixes are included in the 3.4.1.2 release:

  - Fixed an issue that produces a deadlock in Visual Studio when
    Slice compiler output was large enough to fill the output buffer.

  - Fixed support for parallel builds. The Slice compiler was run
    several times, once for each parallel build. Now the Slice
    compiler is run only once, before all parallel builds begin.

  - Fixed an issue that could cause errors with Visual Studio if a
    Slice file was saved while the project was building.

  - Fixed the add-in to work properly when --header-ext and
    --source-ext are present in Extra Compiler Options.

  - Fixed the add-in to support building Freeze demos without the need
    to set environment variables.

  - Fixed the add-in to always open generated files as read only;
    previously the generated files were not opened read only until the
    first project build.

  - Added support for setting the output directory for generated
    files, making the add-in more VCS friendly.

  - Added support for .NET DEVPATH.

  - Added support for canceling changes in configuration dialogs. All
    the configuration dialogs now have Ok, Apply and Cancel buttons
    with the standard semantics.

  - Added warnings to prevent incorrect options from being entered in
    Extra Compiler Options.

  - Added a timestamp to Slice build output, which is only printed
    when trace level is Debug.


The following fixes are included in the 3.4.1.1 release:

  - The add-in now supports command-line builds.

  - The add-in now avoids making extraneous changes to projects that
    could result in merge issues when projects are in a shared
    development.

  - The add-in no longer overrides the debug environment setting for
    PATH, but rather appends appropriately.

  - On the loss of focus when adding an include directory in the Slice
    Include Path, the addition is now saved rather than lost.

  - Fixed an issue where moving a Slice-generated file to a filter so
    that it would be ignored by source control did not always work
    because the generated files could be moved back into the regular
    Source Files list by a build.

  - Improved the tracing output generated by the add-in and changed
    the tracing options.

Notes:

  - The new extension will automatically update and work with projects
    that previously used the old version of the extension. The reverse
    is not true, and as a result, all developers in a team sharing
    project files should use the same version of this extension.
