This is a test for the iconv string converter
(#include <Ice/IconvStringConverter.h).

On Windows, you need to set ICONV_HOME to your Iconv installation,
and put %ICONV_HOME%\bin in your PATH when running the test suite.

The Windows build system assumes that your Iconv DLL uses its own
C runtime library: therefore it's not possible to retrieve Iconv's
errno and we build with -DICE_NO_ERRNO.

Remove this -DICE_NO_ERRNO if you have a better iconv build.
