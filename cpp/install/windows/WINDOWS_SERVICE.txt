Installing IceGrid registry, IceGrid node or Glacier2 router as a
Windows Service
========================================================================

Step 1: Review and edit the configuration file (icegridregistry.cfg, 
icegridnode.cfg or glacier2router.cfg)

Step 2: Create the account for the user that will run the service 
(iceuser in the sample configuration files). This user should be 
initially Administrator (see note below).

Step 3: For the IceGrid registry or node, log on as 'iceuser' and
create any required data/database directory.

Step 4: Install the service, for example:
> icegridregistry --install IceGridRegistry \
  --Ice.Config=C:\Ice-3.2.0\config\icegridregistry.cfg

Step 5: In the Windows Services panel, edit the new Service.
Change "Log on" to use the 'iceuser' account, instead of the Local
System Account.

Step 6: Start the service, and verify that the service starts
properly.

Step 7: Downgrade the 'iceuser' account to a regular Users account
(see note below).

Note: 'iceuser' needs to be Administrator the first time you start the
service if you log messages to the Windows Event Log (see the 
Ice.UseEventLog property).
