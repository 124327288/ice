This file describes how to install the IceGrid registry, IceGrid node,
and Glacier2 router as Windows services.

Please also review the notes below to make sure the correct
permissions are set on your system.

1. Review and edit the appropriate configuration file
   (icegridregistry.cfg, icegridnode.cfg or glacier2router.cfg).

2. We recommend that you use the "Local Service" account to run the
   service. You can also run these services under another regular user
   account.

3. For the IceGrid registry or node create any required data/database
   directory. The sample configuration files use the following two
   directories:

   C:\Documents and Settings\Local Service\Local Settings\Application Data\ZeroC\icegrid\node1
   C:\Documents and Settings\Local Service\Local Settings\Application Data\ZeroC\icegrid\registry

   Under Windows Vista we recommend using:

   C:\Users\Local Service\AppData\Local\ZeroC\icegrid\node1
   C:\Users\Local Service\AppData\Local\ZeroC\icegrid\registry

   Note that once you create these directories you must fix the
   permissions. See the note below.

4. Install the service, for example:

   > icegridregistry --install IceGridRegistry \
     --Ice.Config=C:\Ice-@ver@\config\icegridregistry.cfg

   Installing the service on Windows Vista with UAC enabled requires
   administrator privileges. In this case, run the command shell as
   administrator, right-click the command shell icon and select "Run
   as admin", then execute the installation command.

5. In the Windows Services panel, modify the properties of the new
   service. Change "Log on" to use the "Local Service" account (or
   "NT AUTHORITY\Local Service" on Windows XP), instead of the Local 
   System Account. You must select the password field and clear both 
   entries.

6. Start the service and verify that the service starts properly.


Performance Monitoring and IceGrid node
---------------------------------------

The account running the IceGrid node service must have permissions to
read the following registry key if you intend to use the IceGrid
adaptive load-balancing policy:

HKEY_LOCAL_MACHINE\SOFTWARE\Microsoft\Windows NT\CurrentVersion\Perflib

On Windows Server 2003 or Windows Vista, you don't need to do anything
if you run the IceGrid node with the "Local Service" account (this
account already has the right permissions). Otherwise, if you use
Windows XP or run the IceGrid node service with another user account
than "Local Service" you should edit the permissions of the Perflib
registry key.

The simplest method to do this is to edit the permissions of the
registry key directly.

1. Start regedit. Navigate to the above key.

2. Right click, select "Permissions..."

3. Add permission for the given account. Select "Read". Press OK.

Another method to do this is to add the user to the "Performance
Monitor Users" group. See the following Microsoft article for details:

http://technet2.microsoft.com/WindowsVista/en/library/ab3b2cfc-b177-43ec-8a4d-0bfac62d88961033.mspx?mfr=true


Permissions
-----------

You must pay careful attention to the permissions of the data and
output directories. As previously mentioned under Windows Vista we 
recommend using:

IceGrid.Node.Data=C:\Users\Local Service\AppData\Local\ZeroC\icegrid\node1
IceGrid.Node.Output=C:\Users\Local Service\AppData\Local\ZeroC\icegrid\node1
IceGrid.Registry.Data=C:\Users\Local Service\AppData\Local\ZeroC\icegrid\registry

The node and registry will fail to start unless you take the proper
precautions when creating the directories. For example, to use the
locations shown above first login using an administrator account and
then take the following actions:

1. Start up the file explorer. Navigate to "C:\Users" and create a
   directory named "Local Service" (for Windows XP and Windows Server
   2003 navigate to the correct location).

2. Right-click on the directory, select properties, and select the
   security tab.

3. Select Advanced and Edit.

4. Unselect "Include inheritable permissions from this object's
   parent", select Copy.

5. Remove all Permission entries.

7. Add a permission entry for Local Service, SYSTEM and Administrators
   and grant "Full Control" to each.

8. Select ok, and you are done!

You can also change the permissions of the "Local Service" directory
with the following command:

  > cacls "Local Service" /G SYSTEM:F "Local Service":F Administrators:F

Now you can create the icegrid/registry and icegrid/node1
subdirectories without any further action and the correct permissions
will be used.
