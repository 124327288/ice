The Internet Communications Engine
----------------------------------

Ice is a modern alternative to object middleware such as CORBA or
COM/DCOM/COM+. It is easy to learn, yet provides a powerful network
infrastructure for demanding technical applications. It features an
object-oriented specification language, easy to use C++, Java, Python,
PHP, C#, and Visual Basic mappings, a highly efficient protocol,
asynchronous method invocation and dispatch, dynamic transport
plug-ins, TCP/IP and UDP/IP support, SSL-based security, a firewall
solution, and much more.

Ice is available under the terms of the GNU General Public License
(GPL) (see LICENSE file). Commercial licenses are available for
customers who wish to use Ice with proprietary products. Please
contact sales@zeroc.com for more information about licensing Ice.

If Ice was installed from RPMs, see README.DEMOS for instructions on
building and running the demos. Otherwise, you need to download the
Ice-<version>-demos.tar.gz package from
http://www.zeroc.com/download.html and see the README.DEMOS file
included in that package.

See doc/README.html for information on the documentation included with
this distribution.
