This demo illustrates how to use MFC to create a simple IcePatch2
client application.

The IcePatch2 server must be running before the client can patch,
but a data directory must be prepared in order to run the server.
The contents of the data directory are what the client will receive
during the patch process. For convenience, this example uses its own
source files as the data to be patched.

Assuming that the current working directory is demo/IcePatch2/MFC,
you can prepare the data files with the following command:

$ icepatch2calc .

Next, start the IcePatch2 server:

$ icepatch2server --IcePatch2.Endpoints="tcp -h 127.0.0.1 -p 10000" .

The last argument (".") tells the server to use the current directory
as its data directory.

In another window, start the client:

$ patch --IcePatch2.Endpoints="tcp -h 127.0.0.1 -p 10000"

Before the actual patching can begin, the client needs to know the 
patch directory in which to place the downloaded files. Click the
"..." button to the right of the Patch Directory field and select
the demo/IcePatch2/Patch directory. Finally, click the "Patch"
button to begin the patch process.
