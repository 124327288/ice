This demo illustrates how to use MFC to create a simple client side 
patch application.

Before the client can patch anything the IcePatch2 server must be
running. In order to run the IcePatch2 server a data directory must be
prepared. The contents of the data directory is what the client will 
receive during the patch procedure. For convenience, this demo will 
uses it own files as the data to be patched.

Assuming that the current working directory is .../demo/IcePatch2/MFC
prepare the data files:

$ icepatch2calc .

Start the IcePatch2 server:

$ icepatch2server --IcePatch2.Endpoints="tcp -h 127.0.0.1 -p 10000" .

Start the demo client:

$ client --IcePatch2.Endpoints="tcp -h 127.0.0.1 -p 10000"

Before the actual patching can begin, the client needs to know the 
patch directory in which to place the patch data. Click the "Browse
for Folder" button and select the .../demo/IcePatch2/Patch directory.
Finally, click the "Patch" button to begin the patch procedure.
