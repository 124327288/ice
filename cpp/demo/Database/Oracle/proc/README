Oracle Pro*C/C++ demo
=====================

This demo shows how to implement an Ice server that uses Oracle
through its Embedded SQL (Pro*C/C++) API.

It is a fairly simple demo that illustrates how to:
 - map relational data to Ice objects, in particular convert 
   between Ice and Oracle Pro*C/C++ types.
 - associate an Oracle Pro*C/C++ context and database connection
   to each thread in the Ice server thread pool.
 - use Ice default servants

Pre-requisites
--------------
- Setup an Oracle database with the traditional EMP/DEPT schema. 
With Oracle server 10.2, the corresponding SQL script is 
$ORACLE_HOME/rdbms/admin/utilsamp.sql.

- Review/edit the Oracle.ConnectInfo property in config.server
You may need to change it to connect to your Oracle instance.

Running the demo
----------------
- Start the server:
$ server

- Start the client in a separate terminal:
$ client
