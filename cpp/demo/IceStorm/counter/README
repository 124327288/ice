To run the demo:

Start the IceStorm service:

$ icebox --Ice.Config=config.icebox

This configuration assumes there is a subdirectory named db in the
current working directory.

In a separate window:

$ server

In another window:

$ client

You can then press 'i', 'd' to increment a decrement the counter. If
you want you can create more clients in other windows and observe that
each is initialized and subsequently updated with the current counter
value.
