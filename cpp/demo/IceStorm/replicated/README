This demo demonstrates how to configure and deploy HA IceStorm using
IceGrid.

To run the demo, start the IceGrid service:

$ icegridnode --Ice.Config=config.grid

In a separate window:

$ icegridadmin --Ice.Config=config.grid -e \
    "application add 'application.xml'"
$ subscriber

In another window:

$ publisher

While the publisher continues to run, "tick" messages should be
displayed in the subscriber window.

The IceGrid application described in `application.xml' deploys three
IceStorm service replicas. The IceStorm topic manager must be members
of a replica group and, if publishing is to be replicated, the
publisher endpoints must be part of another replica group. The node
endpoints, used for election of the coordinator, must not be members
of any replica group.

Other than configuration, the subscribers and publishers do not have
to do anything special to take advantage of the replication. The
subscriber and publisher are identical to those contained in the clock
demo. See ../clock/README for instructions on running them.
