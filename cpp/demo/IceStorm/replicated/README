To run the demo:

Start the IceGrid service:

$ icegridnode --Ice.Config=config.grid

This configuration assumes there is a subdirectory named db in the
current working directory.

In a separate window:

$ icegridadmin --Ice.Config=config.grid -e \
    "application add 'application.xml'"
$ subscriber

In another window:

$ publisher

While the publisher continues to run "tick" messages should be
displayed in the subscriber window.
