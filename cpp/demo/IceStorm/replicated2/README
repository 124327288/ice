This demo demonstrates how to configure and deploy IceStorm in a
replicated fashion without using IceGrid.

To run the demo, start the three IceStorm replicas. In three separate
windows:

$ icebox --Ice.Config=config.ib1
$ icebox --Ice.Config=config.ib2
$ icebox --Ice.Config=config.ib3

And then in a separate window:

$ subscriber

In another window:

$ publisher

While the publisher continues to run, "tick" messages should be
displayed in the subscriber window.

The subscribers and publishers do not have to do anything special to
take advantage of the replication. The subscriber and publisher are
identical to the publisher and subscriber in the clock directory. See
../clock/README for instructions on running them.
