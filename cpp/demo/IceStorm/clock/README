To run the demo:

Start the IceStorm service:

$ ../../../bin/icebox --Ice.Config=config_service

This configuration assumes there is a subdirectory named db in the
current working directory.

In a separate window:

$ ../../../bin/icestormadmin --Ice.Config=config -e "create time"
$ ./subscriber

In another window:

$ ./publisher

Ten "tick" messages should be displayed in the subscriber window for
each run of the publisher.
