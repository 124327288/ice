To run the demo:

export ICE_CONFIG=config

or use --Ice.Config=config for all subsequent commands.

Start the IceStorm daemon:

../../bin/icestorm

In a seperate window:

../../../bin/icestormadmin -e "create time"
./subscriber

In another window:

./publisher

For each run of the publisher 10 "tick" messages should be displayed
in the subscriber window.
