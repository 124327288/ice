To run the demo:

export ICE_CONFIG=config

or use --Ice.Config=config for all subsequent commands.

Either start the IceStorm daemon:

../../../bin/icestorm

or to run IceStorm as an IceBox service:

../../../bin/icebox --Ice.Config=config_service

This currently assumes there is a directory called db in the cwd.

In a seperate window:

../../../bin/icestormadmin -e "create time"
./subscriber

In another window:

./publisher

For each run of the publisher 10 "tick" messages should be displayed
in the subscriber window.
