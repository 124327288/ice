To run the demo:

$ export ICE_CONFIG=config

Or use --Ice.Config=config for all subsequent commands.

Start the IceStorm service:

$ ../../../bin/icebox --Ice.Config=config_service

This currently assumes there is a directory called db in the cwd.

In a seperate window:

$ ../../../bin/icestormadmin -e "create time"
$ ./subscriber

In another window:

$ ./publisher

For each run of the publisher 10 "tick" messages should be displayed
in the subscriber window.
