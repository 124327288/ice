To run the demo:

Start the IceStorm service:

$ icebox --Ice.Config=config_service

This configuration assumes there is a subdirectory named db in the
current working directory.

In a separate window:

$ icestormadmin --Ice.Config=config -e "create time"
$ subscriber

Alternately, if you would like your subscriber to use a bi-directional
connection, use:

$ subscriber --bidir

In another window:

$ publisher

Ten "tick" messages should be displayed in the subscriber window for
each run of the publisher.
