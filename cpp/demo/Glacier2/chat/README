This example demonstrates the use of a Glacier2 session to create a
very simple chat server.

To run the demo:

Start the chat server:

$ ./server

In a separate window, start the Glacier2 router:

$ ../../../bin/glacier2router --Ice.Config=config.glacier2

In a separate window, start the client:

$ ./client
