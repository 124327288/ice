This example demonstrates the use of a Glacier2 session to create a
very simple chat server.

To run the demo, first start the chat server:

$ server

In a separate window, start the Glacier2 router:

$ glacier2router --Ice.Config=config.glacier2

In a separate window, start the client:

$ client

If you plan to run this demo using clients running on different
hosts than the glacier2router it is necessary to first modify the
configuration. You need to change the Glacier2.Client.Endpoints propery
in config.glacier2 and the Ice.Default.Router and Callback.Client.Router
properties in config. In all cases you must replace the "-h 127.0.0.1"
paramater with the actual external address of the machine glacer2router 
is running on.
