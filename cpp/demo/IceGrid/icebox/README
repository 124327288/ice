This demo shows a very simple IceGrid deployment, with a single
IceBox server hosting a number of IceBox services.

Setup
-----

Start the IceGrid registry and node with:
 $ icegridnode --Ice.Config=config.grid

Deploy the 'HelloSimpsons' application (in file application.xml) with
the IceGrid Admin graphical tool. If you prefer to use the 
command-line utility, use:
 $ icegridadmin --Ice.Config=config.grid -e \
    "application add 'application.xml'"

Running the Client
------------------

$ client

The client simply calls 'sayHello' on the replicated 'hello' object.

Stopping and restarting IceBox services
---------------------------------------

You may use the IceGrid Admin graphical tool to stop and later
restart IceBox services. You can do the same with the command-line
utility; for example to stop and restart the 'Lisa' service:
