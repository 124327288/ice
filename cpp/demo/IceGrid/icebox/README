This demo shows a very simple IceGrid deployment, with a single
IceBox server hosting a number of IceBox services.

Setup
-----

Start the IceGrid registry and node with:
 $ icegridnode --Ice.Config=config.grid

Deploy the 'HelloSimpsons' application (in file application.xml) with
the IceGrid Admin graphical tool. If you prefer to use the 
command-line utility, use:
 $ icegridadmin --Ice.Config=config.grid -e \
    "application add 'application.xml'"

Running the Client
------------------

$ client

The client simply calls 'sayHello' on the replicated 'hello' object.

Stopping and restarting IceBox services
---------------------------------------

You may use the IceGrid Admin graphical tool to stop and later
restart IceBox services. You can do the same with the command-line
utility; for example to stop and restart the 'Lisa' service:

 $ icegridadmin --Ice.Config=config.grid
 >>> service stop IceBox Lisa
 >>> service start IceBox Lisa

Administration through Glacier2
-------------------------------

This demo also includes the configuration for a Glacier2 router
(DemoGlacier2), to show how you could administer IceGrid from
 "the other side" of a firewall. (In these demo, however, everything
is on the same system).

Follow these steps:

 - connect to the IceGrid registry with icegridadmin or the
   IceGrid Admin graphical utility

 - start the DemoGlacier2 server

 - reconnect to the IceGrid registry with icegridadmin:
   $ icegridadmin --Ice.Default.Router="DemoGlacier2/router:tcp -h localhost -p 4063"

   or with the IceGrid Admin graphical utility using the Routed
   tab of the Login dialog. DemoGlacier2 is configured to use its built-in
   NullPermissionsVerifier, so you can login using any username/password
   combination.
