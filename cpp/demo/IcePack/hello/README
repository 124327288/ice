To run the demo:

For icebox to be able to find the library containing the service, you
must add the current directory to LD_LIBRARY_PATH (Linux) or Path
(Windows). Alternatively, you can copy libHelloService.{so,dll} to a
directory that is in the path.

Start the IcePack service:

$ icepacknode --Ice.Config=config --warn

In a separate window:

$ icepackadmin --Ice.Config=config -e "application add 'application.xml'"
$ ./client

This will deploy the servers described in the file "application.xml"
and start the client.

Messages will be displayed in the IcePack service window.
