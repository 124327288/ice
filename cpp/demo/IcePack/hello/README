The IcePack configuration for this example includes an IceBox
service, which requires that you add the current directory to your
your shared library search path (such as LD_LIBRARY_PATH on Unix
or PATH on Windows). Alternatively, you can copy the shared library
for the example IceBox service (i.e., the file libHelloService.so or
HelloService.dll) to a directory that is already in your search path.

To run the demo, first start the IcePack service:

$ icepacknode --Ice.Config=config --warn

In a separate window:

$ icepackadmin --Ice.Config=config -e "application add 'application.xml'"
$ ./client

This will deploy the servers described in the file "application.xml"
and start the client.

Messages will be displayed in the IcePack service window.

The deployment descriptors contain a "debug" target that configures
the application to display additional tracing information. To deploy
the application with this target, include the "debug" target on the
command line as shown below:

$ icepackadmin --Ice.Config=config -e "application add 'application.xml' debug"

If you have already deployed your application, you can update it with
the following command:

$ icepackadmin --Ice.Config=config -e "application update 'application.xml' debug"
