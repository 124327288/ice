This demo shows how to integrate Google Protocol Buffers with Ice.

The Protocol Buffers distribution and documentation can be found at

  http://code.google.com/apis/protocolbuffers/

This demo was tested with Protocol Buffers version 2.0.3.

We have added new metadata that makes it possible for you to specify
protocol buffers message types in your Slice definitions, with Ice
handling the serialization chores for you automatically. The metadata,
which may only be used on a sequence<byte> type, has the following
syntax in C++:

  cpp:protobuf[:protoc-generated-class]

For example:

  ["cpp:protobuf:tutorial::Person"] sequence<byte> Person;

The type name specified in this example, tutorial::Person, corresponds
to the C++ class generated by the Protocol Buffers compiler (protoc)
for the definition shown below:

  package tutorial;
  message Person { ... };

If the metadata omits the type name, the Slice compiler assumes that
the message type resides in the same namespace as the Slice type. For
example, consider this Slice definition:

  module Demo
  {

  ["cpp:protobuf"] sequence<byte> Person;

  };

In this case the Slice compiler assumes that the message type
corresponds to the C++ type Demo::Person, as shown in the following
definition:

  package Demo;
  message Person { ... };

C++ users must also add another metadata directive so that the header
file generated by the protocol buffers compiler is included properly.
This metadata directive must appear before any other Slice definitions
and has the following syntax:

  [["cpp:include:Person.pb.h"]]

Prior to building the demo, please review Makefile or Makefile.mak in
this directory and adjust the value of PROTOBUF_HOME to reflect the
installation directory of Protocol Buffers on your system.

The debug version of libprotobuf.lib is expected to be in
$(PROTOBUF_HOME)\lib\Debug, and the release version is expected
to be in $(PROTOBUF_HOME\lib\Release.

To build this demo with Visual Studio, you must use Visual Studio 2005
or later and configure it as follows:

  - In Tools->Options, select "VC++ Directories.

    - Select "Executables" and add the location of protobuf.exe.

    - Select "Include files" and add the location the protobuf include
      directory.

  - Right-click Ice.protobuf.client project select "Properties".
    In "Configuration Properties"->"Linker"->General, adjust the
    "Additional Library Directories" property to reflect the location
    of the protobuf library. You need to adjust this for Release and
    Debug mode.

  - Adjust the location of the protobuf library for the Ice.protobuf.server
    project as for the client project.

To run the demo, first start the server:

  $ server

In a separate window, start the client:

  $ client
