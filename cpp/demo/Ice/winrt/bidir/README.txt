This demo shows how to use bidirectional connections for callbacks.
This is typically used if the server cannot open a connection to the
client to send callbacks, for example, because firewalls block
incoming connections to the client.

First follow the instructions in the C++ Ice bidir demo README 
to start the server.

To start the client first build the demo using "Build bidir" command
in "Build" menu.

Deploy the demo using "Deploy bidir" command in "Build" menu.

Then start the "Ice Bidir Demo" application from Windows Start menu.
