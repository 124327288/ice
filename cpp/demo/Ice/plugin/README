This demo illustrates how to write and configure a simple Ice plugin
as well as a Ice Logger plugin.

To run the demo, first start the server:

$ server

In a separate window, start the client:

$ client

Both the client and server use a custom logger which is loaded as
a logger plugin. The server also uses a plugin to implement the
servant for this demo.

Please look in the client and sever configuration files to see the
plugin configuration.

For the server or client to be able to find the library containing the
plugin, you must add the current directory to your shared library
search path (e.g., LD_LIBRARY_PATH on Linux, DYLD_LIBRARY_PATH on Mac
OS X, etc.).  Alternatively, you can copy the library to a directory
that is already in the search path.
