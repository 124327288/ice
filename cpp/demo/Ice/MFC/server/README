The server-side portion of the MFC hello demo. Note that this demo can
be used with the MFC client or any of the other hello clients (for
example, the one in demo/Ice/hello).

To run the demo, first start the server:

$ server

Then start the client:

$ cd ../client
$ client

To test timeouts you can use the "Timeout" check box to set a timeout
on the client proxy and the "Delay" check box to set a delayed response
in the server to cause a timeout.  You will notice that two "Hello World!"
messages will be printed by the server in this case. This is because the
sayHello method is marked as idempotent in the slice, meaning that Ice does
not need to follow the at-most-once retry semantics. See the manual for
more information about retry behavior.
