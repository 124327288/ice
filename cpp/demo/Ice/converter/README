This demo illustrates how to implement and use string converters
with Ice. In this demo the client represents an application that
uses ISO-Latin-1 as it's character set and the server, an application
that just uses plain UTF-8.

To run the demo, first start the server:

$ server

In a separate window, start the client:

$ client
