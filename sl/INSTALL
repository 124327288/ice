Unpack the archive. The sources will be contained in the IceSL-@ver@
subdirectory.


Ice for C#
----------

It is also required to install Ice for C#. It can be downloaded at
the following location:

http://www.zeroc.com/download.html

To run the Ice for Silverlight tests it is necessary to download the
Ice for C# source distribution and compile it rather than just downloading
the binary distribution. The binary distibution does not contain the C#
tests, which are required to run the server side of the tests.


Slice-to-Silverlight translator
--------------------------------

You will need the Slice-to-Silverlight translator (slice2sl) and
preprocessor (icecpp). You can download a binary distribution from the
ZeroC web site, or you can build the Slice-to-Silverlight translator
yourself.

Binary and source distributions for the supported platforms are
available at

http://www.zeroc.com/????/download.html

The directory containing the translator executables must be added to
your PATH. For example, if the translator distribution is installed
in C:\IceSL-@ver@, you must add C:\IceSL-@ver@\bin to your PATH.


Building core
-------------

Follow these steps to build the source:

1) Change to the top-level directory of the Ice for Silverlight source
   distribution.

2) Open config\Make.rules.mak and review the comments that describe
   the settings you can modify. For example, you may wish to enable
   optimization.

3) Run nmake:

   > nmake /f Makefile.mak


Building and running tests and demos
------------------------------------

To build the tests and demos, start Visual Studio 2008 Beta 2 and open
the solution all.sln. Select Build->Build Solution to build all the tests
and demos.

Running each demo/test involves the following:

1) Starting the corresponding server from Ice for C#.

2) Starting the Silverlight web application from Visual Studio 2008 Beta 2.

See the README file in each demo/test directory for a description of the
demo/test and detailed instructions on how to run it.
