Requirements
======================================================================

Windows Version
---------------

Ice for Silverlight has been extensively tested on:

- Windows XP x86 with Internet Explorer 6.0

Note: Ice for Silverlight does not currently work with Firefox or
      Safari.


Compiler
--------

Ice for Silverlight requires:

- Microsoft Visual Studio 2008

  http://msdn2.microsoft.com/en-us/vstudio/aa700831.aspx

- Microsoft Visual Studio 2008 Silverlight Tools

Silverlight Runtime
-------------------

- Silverlight 1.1 Alpha

  http://msdn2.microsoft.com/en-us/silverlight/bb419317.aspx


Slice-to-Silverlight translator
--------------------------------

You will need the Slice-to-Silverlight translator (slice2sl) and
preprocessor (icecpp). You can download a binary distribution from
the ZeroC web site, or you can build the Slice-to-Silverlight
translator yourself.

Binary and source distributions are available at

  http://www.zeroc.com/labs/download.html

The directory containing the translator executables must be added to
your PATH. For example, if the translator distribution is installed
in C:\IceSL-@ver@, you must add C:\IceSL-@ver@\bin to your PATH.


Ice for C#
----------

In order to use Ice for Silverlight it is necessary to also install
Ice for C#. Specifically it is necessary to install a patched version
of the Ice for C# 3.2.1 icecs.dll. You can either download a
precompiled patched DLL or compile the Ice for C# sources yourself
after applying the patch to the Ice for C# source distribution.

The Ice for C# source distribution can be downloaded here:

  http://www.zeroc.com/download.html

The precompiled DLL and the source patch can be downloaded here:

  http://www.zeroc.com/labs/download.html

Once downloaded or compiled the DLL must be installed in the GAC:

  gacutil -i icecs.dll


======================================================================
Compilation
======================================================================

Unpack the archive. The sources will be contained in the IceSL-@ver@
subdirectory.


Building the core DLL
---------------------

Follow these steps to build the source:

1) Change to the top-level directory of the Ice for Silverlight source
   distribution.

2) Open config\Make.rules.cs.mak and review the comments that describe
   the settings you can modify. For example, you may wish to enable
   optimization.

3) Run nmake:

   > nmake /f Makefile.mak


Building the tests and demos
----------------------------

Each test and demo is contained in its own separate solution. To
build the tests and demos do the following:

1) Start the Visual Studio 2008 IDE and open the desired
   solution file (demo\Ice\hello\hello.sln for example).

2) Select Build->Build Solution to build both projects in the
   solution.

3) Repeat for each test or demo.


======================================================================
Running the tests and demos
======================================================================

Since Ice for Silverlight provides client-side functionality only, you
must use Ice servers from another Ice language mapping in order to run
the tests and demos. Any of the Ice 3.2.1 mappings that provide
server-side functionality (C++, Java, C#, Python) can be used.

Note that the Windows binary installer for Ice only contains the Ice
demos, but not the Ice tests. Therefore to run the tests you will need
to download and compile one of the source distributions. They can be
downloaded here:

  http://www.zeroc.com/download.html

To run a test or demo do the following:

1) Start the corresponding server from Ice 3.2.1 package you compiled.
   See the instructions in the Ice 3.2.1 distribution for information
   on how to start the server.

2) Start the Visual Studio 2008 IDE and open the selected
   test or demo solution file.

3) Right click on the WebApplication project and select Properties.
   Select the Web tab, change the Start Action to be a Specific Page
   and choose TestPage.html.

4) Right click on the WebApplication project and select
   Debug->Start new instance. This should cause a browser window to be
   spawned.

5) Click on the button in the browser to run the test or demo.

Installation
======================================================================

Ice for Silverlight does not support automatic installation.
