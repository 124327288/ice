Requirements
======================================================================

- PHP5 (http://www.php.net/downloads.php)
- Ice 1.1.x
- Linux

======================================================================
Building PHP
======================================================================

The Ice extension for PHP currently supports only static builds. After
downloading and extracting the PHP5 source code, you must incorporate
the Ice extension into the PHP5 source tree. There are two ways to do
this:

1) Copy the extension source directory.

   $ cd <icephpdir>
   $ cp -r src/ice <phpdir>/ext

2) Create a symbolic link to the extension:

   $ cd <phpdir>
   $ ln -s <icephpdir>/src/ice ext

You are now ready to configure PHP. To include support for the Ice
extension, use the --with-ice option to specify the location of the
Ice installation:

$ cd <phpdir>
$ ./configure --with-ice=$ICE_HOME ...
$ make

See the PHP documentation for more details on the PHP build process.

======================================================================
Configuring Ice for PHP
======================================================================

The Ice extension currently supports two configuration directives:

- ice.config=<file>

  Specifies the name of an Ice configuration file that should be loaded
  when creating the Ice communicator instance shared by PHP scripts.
  This directive is optional.

- ice.parse=<options> [file ...]

  Specifies the preprocessor options and Slice files to be parsed. This
  directive is optional, however, if no Slice files are parsed, then
  PHP scripts will have very few capabilities. For example, scripts
  will be able to invoke basic proxy operations, but will not be able
  to use any user-defined types.

It is important to note that access to configuration and Slice files
may be restricted, depending on PHP's execution context, such as
when running as an Apache module in a process that has been chroot()ed.
