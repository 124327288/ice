This is a PHP version of the Ice "value" demo client. First, start the
C++ or Java version of the value demo server on the same host. Then
run this client with the following command:

$ php -c php.ini -f Client.php

Note that this client requires user input, therefore you must run this
example using the CLI version of the PHP interpreter.
