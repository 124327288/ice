Changes since version 1.0.0
---------------------------

- Minor fixes for compatibility with PHP 5.0.0b2.

- Fixes for Ice 1.2.0 API changes. The ice_flush operation has been
  removed from proxies, and the operation flushBatchRequests has been
  added to the communicator.

- The base Ice exception class (Ice_Exception) now derives from the PHP
  base exception class (Exception). Also, the mapping for exceptions now
  supports an optional string argument to constructors. This argument
  represents the exception "message" and is passed to the base Exception
  constructor unmodified.
